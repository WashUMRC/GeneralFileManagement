# GeneralFileManagement

- dicomAndTiffCleaner removes any and all DICOM files and TIF images from both scanning systems. Intended for periodic system cleanup.

- UpdateDependencies can be run to automatically clone or update the repositories on GitHub. It will run explicitly on the repos identified in the cell array of strings; if a new one is added, this file must be updated to reflect that.
